### Hackathon: Managing Your Own Data with EnzymeML Tools

This session is designed to familiarize participants with the EnzymeML tools through an interactive workshop. It begins with an introduction to the EnzymeML Suite, a comprehensive grapgical application for creating and visualizing EnzymeML documents. The session will also highlight interoperability with various libraries, showcasing integrations with tools like MTPHandler, NMRPy, and Catalax to enhance versatility and functionality. Thereafter, brought datasets will be read in, with the EnzymeML tools [`chromatopy`](https://fairchemistry.github.io/chromatopy/) for chromatographic measurements, [`mtphandler`](https://fairchemistry.github.io/MTPHandler/), as well as [`nmrpy`](https://nmrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

__Requirements__:

To participate in the hands-on session, the following hardware and software are required:

- **Laptop** with an up-to-date operating system (e.g., recent Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system)
- [**Anaconda** installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/):

Anaconda simplifies installing and managing Python, Jupyter, and essential tools. It bundles everything you need, including numerous libraries, making it perfect for beginners and advanced users.

__Bringing Your Own Data__:

We provide a selection of prepared datasets for use during the workshop. If you plan to utilize your own data, see the following list of supported devices and file formats:

- Plate reader data
    - BioTek, Magellan, Multiskan Spektrum, Multiskan Skyhigh, or Spectramax 190, Tecan Spark
- Chromatographic data
    - refere to the supported formats and data preparation in the [documentation of `chromatopy`](https://fairchemistry.github.io/chromatopy/supported_formats/)
- NMR data
    - FIDs of NMR measurements (e.g., Bruker, Varian)

You should also bring data from calibration measurements if applicable.
