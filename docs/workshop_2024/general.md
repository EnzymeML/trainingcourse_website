We are glad to invite you to our **5th EnzymeML Workshop** at the Hotel Jagdschloss Niederwald in Rüdesheim (Germany) on **24.-26.9.2024**. Rüdesheim can conveniently be reached by train from Frankfurt airport (1½ h). During the three-day meeting, we will demonstrate and explore the application of our EnzymeML platform during the first EnzymeML Training Course, discuss challenges (especially data acquisition and data analysis), and jointly plan the next steps. We would be glad if you and your co-worker(s) would participate, contribute a dataset for testing, give a talk, and contribute to the discussion.
