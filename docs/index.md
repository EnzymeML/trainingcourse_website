# EnzymeML Training Course

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
The EnzymeML Training Course is a collaborative project between multiple biocatalysis groups. The aim of this project is to jointly develop computational tools, data standards, and best practices for the analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Furthermore, the project provides training for Python-based data analysis of experimental data.

## üöÄ Motivation
Current state of data analysis and implications on reproducibility and scalability...

## üìö Stages
The project is structured into three stages, dividing the task of implementing generic analysis workflows for biocatalytic data:  

### 1. Making experimental data accessible
Development of generic Python tools, allowing reading in unprocessed data from various analytical sources such as spectrophotomety, chromatograph, or NMR. The tools facilitate the preprocessing of the data, concentration calculation, and the generation of EnzymeML files.

### 2. Data Analysis
Depending on the needs of the project members, existing Python tools will be used or extended to analyze the data. Experimental questions 
Development of Python-based tools for the analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  

### 3. In-person Workshop
During a three-day workshop, the project members will be trained in the use of the developed tools and their implementation in Jupyter notebooks to form custom analysis workflows.
