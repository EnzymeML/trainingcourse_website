## Why EnzymeML?

EnzymeML is a data model for catalyzed reaction data.

It sets information on small molecules, proteins, and their reaction in context with reaction conditions and the measured data.

EnzymeML is a standardized data model allowing for exchange of data among colleagues, database providers, and data science tools.


## How to use EnzymeML?

Besides the data model, different tools are available to accelerate your processing and analysis of catalyzed reaction data.
