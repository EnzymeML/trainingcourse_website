## Why EnzymeML?

## Unlock the Full Potential of Your Biocatalytical Data

This training course is designed to empower researchers, scientists, and data analysts in biocatalysis by equipping them with the skills to manage and analyze experimental data beyond traditional Excel workflows. By leveraging Python and AI-driven tools, participants will enhance their ability to structure, process, and interpret complex datasets while ensuring adherence to FAIR data principles.

## Goals

### 1. Move Beyond Excel: Smarter Data Management

Excel is a widely used tool in biocatalysis, but it has limitations when handling large-scale, multidimensional datasets. This course provides participants with alternative approaches that allow for:

- Efficient data structuring and processing.
- Automated workflows that reduce errors and improve reproducibility.
- Scalable solutions for large datasets that exceed Excel's capabilities.

### 2. Apply Python Directly to Your Research Data

Unlike generic coding courses that rely on theoretical examples, this training is focused on your own experimental data. Participants will:

- Work with their real-world datasets from their research projects.
- Learn how to manipulate and analyze biocatalytical data using Python.
- Gain hands-on experience in integrating computational tools into their workflows.

### 3. Simplified Python Learning with AI Assistance

For participants new to Python, the learning curve can be steep. This course integrates AI-driven tools to facilitate:

- Code generation and debugging support.
- Step-by-step guidance in writing and optimizing Python scripts.
- Automated solutions for routine data processing tasks.

### 4. Ensure FAIR Compliance with EnzymeML

The course emphasizes FAIR-compliant data management, ensuring that experimental results are:

- **Findable** – Easily searchable and indexed for future reference.
- **Accessible** – Structured in a way that allows seamless data sharing.
- **Interoperable** – Compatible with other datasets and computational tools.
- **Reusable** – Properly documented and standardized to support further research.

Through hands-on training, participants will learn how to generate EnzymeML documents, a standardized format for enzymatic reaction data that enhances data exchange and reproducibility.
